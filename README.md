## Food Trucks Project

### Second week homework for Skill Distillery
Course Began: 9/9/19

Assigned: 9/27/19

Completed: 9/28/19


### Overview
This application creates an airfield, which holds a fleet of jets. There are several types of jets, each with different capabilities. The application also displays a menu for users, with options for them to complete.

The purpose of this exercise is to incorporate all that we've learned in the course during our first 3 weeks, with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming and it's four pillars: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation.

Upon starting the app, a fleet of several jets are imported from an existing text file. The user is then presented with a (self-explanatory) menu, allowing them to: List the entire fleet, Fly all Jets, View the Fastest Jet, View Jet with Longest Range, Load all Cargo Jets, Load all Passenger Jets, Dogfight!!!!, Add a Jet to the Fleet, Remove a Jet from the Fleet, Save Jet Fleet to a text file, or Quit the application.

### How to run
This is a console app:
1. Compile and run it in Terminal, any IDE, etc.
2. Make Menu selections/enter data as requested.
3. Quit via the Menu

### Lessons Learned
As with the other projects so far, this one reinforced the importance of planning before coding. Taking time to think through the application, create even a basic UML diagram, and stubbing out classes and methods, saves a great deal of time overall.

In the future, I would like to begin learning and utilizing Test Driven Development very intensely, in an effort to save time, while also making future modifications simpler.
