### Overview


### How to run
This is a console app:
1. Compile and run it in Terminal, an IDE, etc.
2. Enter data as requested, & make the appropriate menu choices.

### Technologies/Topics Used
1. java.util.Scanner
2. Arrays
3. Objects/Classes
4. Encapsulation
5. data types:

  *double

  *boolean

  *int

  *String

6. conversions:

  *implicit

  *explicit

  *promotions

7. loops:

  *do while

  *break

  *for

8. conditionals:

  *if/else

7. arithmetic/calculations
8. Methods (with parameters & return values)

### Lessons Learned
I learned that if you don't force Scanner to take a nextLine() after taking nextInt(),that it will skip your input completely because nextInt() doesn't take the carriage return.

I learned that it is much easier to complete the program by first deciding exactly what needs to be done, and then stubbing out methods to do those things, and finally filling in the methods with the appropriate logic one at a time.
